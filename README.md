#Title
Implementation of Topic Modelling on Amazon Musical Instrument Reviews using PySpark and SparkNLP.

#Introduction
A Topic Modelling is a type of statistical model in machine learning and natural language processing to discover the abstract "topics" that occur in a set of documents. The dataset which we are using for Topic Modelling is Amazon Musical Instruments reviews corpus and will try to find the hidden topics from the corpus. In this study, the topic modelling algorithm which we have implemented is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is an example of a topic model and is used to categorise text into a specific topic in a document. The open source software that I am planning to work with is PySpark and SparkNLP.
